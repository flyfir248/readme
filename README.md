# What is a confusion matrix? Name two performance metrics and describe how they can be calculated from the confusion matrix.

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. The matrix is typically used to summarize the performance of a classification algorithm, and it is often used in machine learning and in particular in the field of medical diagnosis.

Two performance metrics that can be calculated from a confusion matrix are accuracy and precision.

Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, and it can be calculated by summing the diagonal elements of the confusion matrix and dividing by the total number of predictions.

Precision is a measure of a classifier's exactness. It can be calculated as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives.

Both of these metrics are generally expressed as a percentage or a decimal between 0 and 1, where 1 represents perfect performance and 0 represents the worst possible performance.
